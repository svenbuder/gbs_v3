# Gaia Benchmark Stars, enhanced version 3

This version of the Gaia Benchmark Stars catalogue is based on [https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231011302S/abstract](Soubiran et al. (2023)).

I have reformated their Table 6 and used the VizieR to match the HIP identifiers with the closest and brightest 2MASS identifiers and their 2MASS J2000 coordinates. The resulting table is saved as **gbs_v3_gdr3_tmass.csv** and **gbs_v3_gdr3_tmass.fits** file.
